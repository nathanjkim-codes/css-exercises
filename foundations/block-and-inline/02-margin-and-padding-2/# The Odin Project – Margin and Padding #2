# Margin and Padding #2

This is a solution to **"Margin and Padding #2"**, a CSS layout exercise from [The Odin Project - Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
The goal is to recreate a simple card layout using margin and padding to control spacing and alignment.

## ✅ Self Check

Use this checklist to verify the layout:

- ✅ There is **8px padding** between the edge of the card and its content (the blue sections).
- ✅ There is an **8px gap** between each of the blue sections inside the card.
- ✅ The title of the card uses a **16px font**.
- ✅ There are **8px of padding** between the title text and the edge of the title section.
- ✅ The content section has **16px padding top/bottom**, and **8px padding left/right**.
- ✅ Everything inside the `.button-container` is **centered** and has **8px padding**.
- ✅ The Big Button is **centered on its own line**.
- ✅ The Big Button has **24px side padding**, and **8px top/bottom padding**.

## ✅ What I Learned

Through this exercise, I learned:

- The difference between `margin` (external spacing) and `padding` (internal spacing).
- How to use **shorthand syntax** like `padding: 16px 8px;` and what each value represents.
- That **`margin-bottom`** is used to create space _between_ elements, such as `.title` and `.content`.
- That **`padding`** is used to create space _inside_ elements, like `.title`’s text inside its background.
- The importance of `display: block;` and `margin: 0 auto;` to **center a button horizontally**.
- How to read a layout visually and translate it into CSS spacing rules.

This helped reinforce how visual spacing works in the **box model**, and how to control it precisely using CSS.
