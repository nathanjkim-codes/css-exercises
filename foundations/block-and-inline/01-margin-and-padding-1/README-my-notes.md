# 🧩 CSS Exercises – Margin and Padding Practice

This is one of the practice assignments from **The Odin Project’s CSS Foundations course**, specifically from the `css-exercises` repository.

📁 Exercise Path: `css-exercises/foundations/01-margin-and-padding-1`

---

## 🎯 Goal

Edit the `style.css` file so that the divs visually match the layout shown in the provided image (`desired-outcome.png`).  
👉 Only the **margin** and **padding** values should be changed.  
❌ Do not modify the HTML or add new CSS properties.

---

## ✅ Self-check List

- [x] Div One and Div Three have **32px padding** between their text and borders.
- [x] Div One has **12px margin** around it to separate it from other elements.
- [x] There is a **48px gap** between Div Two and Div Three.
- [x] Div Three is aligned **to the right** using `margin-left: auto`.
- [x] No `float`, `flex`, or `position` was used.

## 💡 What I Learned

- The **difference between margin and padding**:
  - `padding` → space between content and border (inside the box).
  - `margin` → space between the element and others (outside the box).
- How to apply `margin-left: auto` to align elements **to the right**.
- How **vertical margin collapsing** works.
- How to use **shorthand syntax** for margin and padding (`margin: top right bottom left`).
- How to style elements using only spacing techniques — no layout systems like Flex or Grid.
